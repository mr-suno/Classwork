# Classroom Managing System
Class project finished on **1/23/2025**
- Includes an organized Terminal-based interface
- Support for adding, removing, and gathering student information

## Bugs 🪲
> [!NOTE]
> Some bugs I know about that I'm too lazy to fix
1. The grades array gets cut off when adding new student(s)
2. Different students can have the same ID (No performant bugs, just identication issues)

## My Grade ⚙️
The simple project earned me an A+ (100%) for this basic app
